# HiDiffEnergy: A Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Energy Load Generation

HiDiffEnergy is a deep learning project for generating high-fidelity, long-sequence synthetic residential energy load profiles.  
It utilizes a two-stage hierarchical diffusion model to capture both the long-term structure and the short-term volatile details of electricity consumption and solar generation data from the **Ausgrid dataset**.

## Abstract
Generating realistic long-term energy consumption and solar
generation data is challenging because the data contain multi-
scale temporal features, ranging from long-term seasonal
trends to short-term daily and hourly households behaviors.
Existing generative approaches tend to overlook this multi-
scale nature, capturing either large-scale trends or small-scale
variations, but rarely both. We propose HiDiff-Energy, a hier-
archical diffusion framework with two stages. The high-level
model captures global dynamics over weeks and months,
while the low-level adds high-frequency, household-level
variations. To handle long sequences efficiently, the low-level
trains on shorter segments but produces outputs that remain
coherent across the full time span. The model also includes
conditional embeddings of household identity and tempo-
ral context, which help preserve each householdâ€™s unique
consumption patterns. With this hierarchical design, HiDiff-
Energy can generate realistic, individualized energy data over
extended periods, accurately modeling both large-scale trends
and fine-scale features

## Features
- **Hierarchical Generation**: Coarse-to-fine approach generates long, coherent time-series data.  
- **Conditional Modeling**: Conditioned on household, temporal, and seasonal factors for context-aware and diverse profiles.
